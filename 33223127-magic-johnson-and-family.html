It was absurd. I think it was from many years ago and it was a flop, but to me it was great TV. It was about extremely spoiled Hollywood black kids who just partied and shopped all the time. They did a lot of drugs (off camera). One girl on the show was later found overdosed and dead by a highway overpass in the Bronx and the family tried to cover it up because “Our little princess went to Stanford!! She never did drugs!!!” And I forgot, they discovered she was pregnant during the autopsy. Anyway I highly recommend this reality show to anyone who wants some mindless entertainment . It’s not about race… it’s about good looking, rich, social Beverly Hills brats living it up in NYC. EJ was absurd in it, he was queening out in Hermes nearly every episode</p><table class="info small"><tr><td class=by>by <span>Anonymous</span></td><td class=count>reply 22</td><td class=timestamp><span>July 18, 2023 7:33 PM</span></td></tr></table><p>^ That white lady sure stands out like a sore thumb 🙄</p><table class="info small"><tr><td class=by>by <span>Anonymous</span></td><td class=count>reply 24</td><td class=timestamp><span>July 28, 2023 1:44 PM</span></td></tr></table><p>Since Daddy bought into the Washington Commanders I hope to meet lots of hot football mens.</p><table class="info small"><tr><td class=by>by <span>Anonymous</span></td><td class=count>reply 26</td><td class=timestamp><span>July 28, 2023 2:55 PM</span></td></tr></table><p>The real problem with EJ is that he is profoundly stupid, utterly lacking in talent and doesn't even have a nice personality - not to mention that he is extremely unattractive, even with all the makeup hiding his real hideous self.

I used to work in a store and LaTanya Jackson was a client, Samual's wife. Her and Cookie Johnson are friends along with Holly Robinson Peete. They go to the South of France and swing through Capri and Positano and all those places. I remember seeing Magic Johson standing inline for gelato, just like everyone else at Buonocore in Capri. He was just a cool laid back guy. It was funny because he is huge and towered over everyone but he was a sport and waited his turn as people came up to take pictures with him. I am not sure if Denzel is part of the group too. But little fun fact is that Denzel is like the unofficial Mayor of Positano.

He's lost a lot of weight. He had a gastric sleeve I read. He says that when that grotesque attention whore Caitlyn Jenner transed he considered it but decided against it. I can certainly understand that because Jenner is gross and offputting to everyone. So basically EJ's just a super flamboyant and colorful guy who is basically like a hooker looking drag queen. Like RPDR 24/7 Whore Season.</p><p>What really jumped out to me was how much he seems to be warmly loved by his family and friends. They all seem like really solid, good and loving people.
