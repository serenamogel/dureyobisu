As you said, sand, in contrast to water-dense meals, does not carry electricity. However, with a microwave, the food is not cooked by electricity, but rather by being bombarded with microwaves for a period of time. If light radiation is capable of heating up sand, then microwaves are likewise capable of heating up sand that has been placed in a microwave oven.
